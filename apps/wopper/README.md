# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

### Building and running your application

When you're ready, start your application by running:
`docker compose up --build`.

Your application will be available at http://localhost:4173.

### Deploying your application to the cloud

First, build your image, e.g.: `docker build -t myapp .`.
If your cloud uses a different CPU architecture than your development
machine (e.g., you are on a Mac M1 and your cloud provider is amd64),
you'll want to build the image for that platform, e.g.:
`docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t myapp .`.

Then, push it to your registry, e.g. `docker push myregistry.com/myapp`.

Consult Docker's [getting started](https://docs.docker.com/go/get-started-sharing/)
docs for more detail on building and pushing.

This webapp takes 2 variables:

- `EPIC_CONTENT`: the content to be dispalyed
- `EPIC_NAME`: the title of the content
